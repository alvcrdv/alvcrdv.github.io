In this project, I implemented the 
<a href="https://doi.org/10.54783/jser.v5i2.259" target="_blank">Sentiment Analysis Paper</a> 
by Widayanti, C., & Fridiyanti, Y. N. (2023) into a stable-baselines3 implementation of PPO. 
Additionally, I reproduced the original sentiment analysis results by tracking my experiments using the 
SVM (Support Vector Machine) technique.

I also wrote an article elaborating on the theory of SVM and my results and submitted it to Senovtik!
