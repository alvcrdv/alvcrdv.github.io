<p>Comprehensive Analysis of User Purchasing Behavior and Market Trends.</p>

<p>
This project focuses on analyzing **user purchasing behavior and market trends** using structured data. The dataset contains key insights into **customer retention, sales performance, and regional preferences**.
</p>

<p>
Using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualized key metrics such as **churn probability, purchase frequency, and customer segmentation**. The cleaned dataset was then integrated into **Tableau** to create interactive dashboards.
</p>

<h3>Key Highlights:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>📊 <strong>Purchase Frequency & Order Value Analysis</strong></li>
  <li>📍 <strong>Regional Sales & Churn Probability Visualization</strong></li>
  <li>📅 <strong>Seasonal and Retention Strategy Insights</strong></li>
  <li>📈 <strong>Lifetime Value vs Churn Probability Correlation</strong></li>
</ul>
