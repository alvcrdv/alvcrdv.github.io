<p>Comprehensive Analysis of Chase Bank Branch Performance and Efficiency.</p>

<p>
This project focuses on analyzing the efficiency and performance of Chase Bank branches across the United States. The dataset includes details such as branch location, establishment dates, and deposit amounts over multiple years.
</p>

<p>
Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Folium), I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualized key metrics such as deposit growth, branch efficiency, and geospatial distribution. The cleaned dataset was then integrated into interactive maps for further insights.
</p>

<h3>Key Highlights:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>📊 Deposit Growth & Branch Efficiency Analysis</li>
  <li>📍 Geospatial Mapping of Chase Bank Branches</li>
  <li>📅 Historical Trends in Deposits and Acquisitions</li>
  <li>📈 Top Performing and Least Performing Branch Insights</li>
</ul>
