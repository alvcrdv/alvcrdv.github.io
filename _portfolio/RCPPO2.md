<p>Comprehensive Analysis of User Purchasing Behavior and Market Trends.</p>

<p>
This project focuses on analyzing user purchasing behavior and market trends using structured data. The dataset contains key insights into customer retention, sales performance, and regional preferences.
</p>

<p>
Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualized key metrics such as churn probability, purchase frequency, and customer segmentation. The cleaned dataset was then integrated into Tableau to create interactive dashboards.
</p>

<h3>Key Highlights:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>📊 Purchase Frequency & Order Value Analysis</li>
  <li>📍 Regional Sales & Churn Probability Visualization</li>
  <li>📅 Seasonal and Retention Strategy Insights</li>
  <li>📈 Lifetime Value vs Churn Probability Correlation</li>
</ul>
