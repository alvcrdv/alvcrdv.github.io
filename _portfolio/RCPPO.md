In this project, I implemented the [Sentiment analysis Paper](https://doi.org/10.54783/jser.v5i2.259) by Widayanti, C., & Fridiyanti, Y. N. (2023) into a stable-baselines3 implementation of PPO. Additionally, I reproduced the original sentiment analysis results by tracking my experiments using SVM(Support Vector Machne) technique. The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/v1nusss/sentiment-analysis). I also wrote an article elaborating on the theory of SVM and my results and submitted it to the Senovtik!
