Currently, I am working diligently on my Master's Thesis, focusing on innovative approaches to news detection modeling.

## 📽️ Passion for Mentorship

Beyond my academic pursuits, I am passionate about mentoring and guiding others through the dynamic fields of Machine Learning and academia.

## 🏆 Selected Experience

### 🤖 Open Source Contributions

I have made significant contributions to the [Senovtik Seminar](https://sinovik.menpan.go.id/), an extensive open-source project dedicated to Social Media Twitter Sentiment Analysis concerning Gibran Rakabuming's candidacy for Vice President in 2024.

Additionally, I have authored a [related paper](https://v1nusss.github.io/alvinus-cardova.github.io/publications/) presented at the National Seminar on Information & Communication Technology Innovation (SENOVTIK) 2023.

### 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers

My independent research endeavors include:
- Implementing the Information Technology and Computer Science paper from Universitas Muhammadiyah Riau
- Successfully reproducing the original results by accurately detecting fake news

To disseminate my findings, I have submitted papers to **FASILKOM** journals, elucidating the theoretical framework and empirical results of my research. For further details, please review my specific [portfolio entry](https://v1nusss.github.io/alvinus-cardova.github.io/portfolio/).
